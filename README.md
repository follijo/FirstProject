# FirstProject
This project is to make a grocery list of items and how many times they were purchased. Using reading/writing to a file and sending information between two programming languages. This Projects shows the use of different libraries, calls functions and uses a switch.
The thing I think I did particularly well was reading and writing to a file in two different languages which use to cause me a lot of trouble.
I could enhance my code with putting less in my main and making another function to handle what is the main. By doing this it would make my code to be read more easily if anyone wanted to make changes.
The most challenging thing for me to write was how to read something that is on one line of a file and break it into two separate strings then take on of the strings and type cast that into an int and then only use the second one every other time. I solved this using modulo and I Googled how to separate a string and while reading a file.
Reading/writing to a file, manipulating data, using two languages are all good skills that will be required for any project that I will be a part of in the future.
I tried to put as little in my main as I could at the time, I used multiple functions and I tried to make all my comments very clear to make my overall code easily readable and able to be maintained.
